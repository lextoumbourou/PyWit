Installation
============

You can install PyWit via pip:

::

    > pip install PyWit

Or if you're prefer, via easy_install:

::

    > easy_install PyWit

Or by checking out the latest version from Github and using the setup script:

::

    > git clone git@github.com:lextoumbourou/PyWit.git
    > cd PyWit
    > python setup.py install

PyWit has only the `requests <http://requests.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ module as a dependency. You can install that via pip, if you have to:

::

    > pip install requests
